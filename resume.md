I specialize in rapid development of highly reliable, performant, scalable, minimal,
clear and maintainable solutions to difficult problems.

As a hobby, I build small open-source Python libraries that do one useful thing well:

## Employment Highlights

### <span>Lead Programmer, SuperDuperDB</span> <span>(May 2023 -- Sep 2023)</span>

https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb

SuperDuperDB is not a database, but a Python system to integrate existing databases with
AI tools like vector search and large language models.

I was tasked with making the working Python codebase "professional" so it could be
released to the public as a library.

And this I did, by writing many `pytest` tests, adding practically complete typing,
enforced with `mypy`, some refactoring and renaming and as much removing as possible.

As I went, I also wrote reams of readable class, method and function documentation.

I also got to write some design documents, really my favorite part.

One was for structured logging, monitoring, and journaling, which had a small but
useful API, and allowed repeatable computation with fairly marginal extra effort.
I got it down to three pages, and had a demo of the API as a `pytest` unit test.

The other design document was for a fully typed server with an automatically generated
OpenAPI specification, instead of the existing ad hoc REST server, using FastAPI and
Pydantic, and this too came with a tiny demo, one that could actually serve stuff.

### <span>CTO, Engora</span> <span>(April 2021 -- Feb 2023)</span>

[Engora](https://search.engora.tech/) was an innovative search engine for mechanical
engineering parts.

The founder created a good demo, and then raised money through crowdfunding and
Reddit. I came in some months after that, first as a consultant and then as CTO.

As the CTO I had my hands in everything, but here are the bits I wrote all of (Python,
PostgreSQL, SqlAlchemy):

* A _parts crawler_ over two dozen disparate websites totalling almost a million parts,
carefully rate-limited, first harvested directly, then proxied, finally using
ScraperAPI's fancy new asynchronous proxy.

* A PostgreSQL _parts database_ with key information from each parts page: I wrote a
small database quickly, and then four months later, I rewrote it entirely.

* A _data store_ based on S3, replicated over multiple providers and with an incremental
offsite "physical" backup stream; and on top of that, a _data resource management
system_, for convenient replication of resources, and projects containing multiple,
reproducible resources, including PostgreSLQ databases, directories and sharded files.

* A neat little proprietary _memory-mapped index_ for direct searching and
retrieval, and [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for text
searching.

* A Flask _web server_ (using nginx/gunicorn in production) and a couple of Dockers
  supporting all of these.

* Deployment, configuration files and variables, monitoring variables, logging, user
interaction journaling, and other unsexy but satisfying details.

* "Practically complete" test coverage of everything

* And to run all of those, a tidy [`typer`](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) CLI
named `engora`, with over two dozen commands and subcommands, hundreds of flags
and "practically complete" documentation,  used every day by almost everyone in the
company.

### <span>Lead developer on BiblioPixel, Maniacal Labs</span> <span> (2016-2019)

Maniacal Lab's BiblioPixel was a popular lighting control program written in
Python that controlled LEDs in strips, matrices, cubes and other layouts, as
well as other lighting systems such as the Philips Hue and DMX.

I rewrote it from the ground up, with a REST server for pixel and higher-level
control, both code and data plug-ins, animators including video feedback with an
IIR filter, and a new data model using `numpy` arrays, leading to very roughly a
30x speedup with perfect backwards compatibility.

Mostly Python, some Cython and C++. (I'd use
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instead of Cython if I
had to do it again.)

### <span>Senior software engineer at Ripple </span> <span>(2014-2016) </span>

Ripple is a financial technology firm with its own eponymous cryptocurrency. I
worked on their flagship application `rippled`, the complex and complicated
C++17 crypto-ledger that implements their XRP cryptocurrency, on the ledger
code, on deployment, debugging, devops, build and monitoring, mostly in C++ with
some Python.

While this was a challenging and very educational position, I am not willing to work in
the cryptocurrency field at this time.

### <span>CTO, World Wide Woodshed </span> <span>(2009-2014) </span>

I had always wanted to write a complete desktop audio application!

World Wide Woodshed's SlowGold was a leader in music practice software from the
1990s. I bought half the tiny company, and was the sole developer for a
brand-new product in C++, with high-quality audio, subtle and intuitive editing
tools, and little details like three second restart after shutdown.

### <span>Software engineer, Google </span> <span> (2004-2009) </span>

I joined Google New York when it was a single floor overlooking Times Square,
worked on Google's first question-answering system, the first Music Search, then
its short-lived Real Estate search.

This led me to GoogleBase, a database of tens of billions of items planned for
millions of users. Leading a tiny and changing team, over two years we built a
universal reporting and computation framework I had proposed and designed. It
was still in common use years later.

As a reward for this slog, I was privileged to work on GWS, the front end program,
written in C++ that generated all Google results pages, for i18n, l10n and translations,
and the GWS live experiment framework.

And I interviewed hundreds of engineers, traveling twice to Korea and once to
Hungary for this.

I used C++, Java and Python, and the usual string of Google technologies.

### <span> Senior software developer, Netomat </span> <span> (2001-2004) </span>

Netomat had an innovative rich media tool to let users and advertisers create
and send Netomat "experiences" â€“ little Java applet (it seemed more reasonable
at the time) minisites with animation, sound and internal navigation - to users
who could edit them within the email itself.

I designed and wrote the animation engine and front-end, most of the animation
types and the manual.

Still one of my favorite "neat hacks" ever, I wrote a tool that converted
"experiences" (animations) right into Java bytecode, for a 40-80% savings in
download and memory size.
