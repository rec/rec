Decades of experience; a plethora of projects taken from conception to
completion and production, in areas including search, big data, audio and DSP,
fintech, distributed systems, real time systems and lighting control, and more;
hundreds of thousands of lines of working, tested production code in two dozen
programming languages; expert in Python and C++.

I specialize in rapid development of highly reliable, performant, scalable,
minimal, clear and maintainable solutions to difficult problems. "Everything
should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."

## Employment Highlights

### <span>CTO, Engora</span> <span>April 2021 -- Jan 2023</span>

[Engora](https://engora.tech/) is an innovative search engine for mechanical
engineering parts.

The founder created a good demo and then raised money through crowdfunding and
Reddit and I came in after that, first as a consultant and then as CTO.

As the only full-time programmer I had my hands in everything, but here are the
parts I wrote all of, all in Python:

* A _parts crawler_ over two dozen disparate websites totalling almost a million
parts, carefully rate-limited, first directly, then proxied, finally using
ScraperAPI's fancy new asynchronous proxy, with a _searchable HTTP cache_ in
PostgreSQL.

* A _data store_ based on S3, replicated over multiple providers and with an
incremental offsite "physical" backup, and a _data resource management system_
written on top of the data store, for convenient replication of resources, and
projects containing multiple resources, including databases and sharded files.

* A neat little proprietary _memory-mapped index_ for direct searching and
retrieval, and [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for text
searching.

* Configuration files and variables, monitoring variables, logging, user
interaction journaling, and other unsexy but satisfying details.

* "Practically complete" test coverage of everything

* And to run and keep track of all of those, a tidy
[`typer`](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) CLI named `engora`, with over two dozen
commands and subcommands, hundreds of flags and "practically complete"
documentation.

### <span>Contractor, A-Team</span> <span>January 2021 -- January 2022</span>

[A-Team](https://www.a.team/) is a consultancy firm with a very usable billing
and organization system, and a competent, warm and supportive management, that
provided me with solid but unremarkable programming C++ and Python contracts.

### <span>Lead developer on BiblioPixel, Maniacal Labs</span> <span> (2016-2019)

Maniacal Lab's BiblioPixel was a popular lighting control program written in
Python to control LEDs in strips, matrices, cubes and other layouts, as well as
other lighting systems such as the Philips Hue and DMX.

I rewrote it from the ground up, with a REST server for pixel and higher-level
control, both code and data plug-ins, animators including video feedback with an
IIR filter, and a new data model using `numpy` arrays, leading to very roughly a
30x speedup with perfect backwards compatibility. Mostly Python, some Cython and
C++. (I'd use [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) if I had to
do it again.)

### <span>Senior software engineer at Ripple </span> <span>(2014-2016) </span>

Ripple is a financial technology firm with its own eponymous cryptocurrency. I
worked on their flagship application `rippled`, a complex and complicated C++17
crypto-ledger that actually implements their cryptocurrency, on the ledger code,
on deployment, debugging, devops, build and monitoring. Mostly in C++ with some
Python.

### <span>CTO, World Wide Woodshed </span> <span>(2009-2014) </span>

I had always wanted to write a complete desktop audio application!

World Wide Woodshed's SlowGold was a leader in music practice software from the
1990s. I bought half the tiny company, and was the sole developer for a
brand-new product in C++, with high-quality audio, subtle and intuitive editing
tools, and little details like three second restart after shutdown.

### <span>Software engineer, Google </span> <span> (2004-2009) </span>

I joined Google New York when it was a single floor on Times Square, worked on
their first question-answering system, the first Music Search, then its
short-lived Real Estate search.

This led me to GoogleBase, a database of tens of billions of items planned for
millions of users. Leading a tiny and changing team, over two years we built a
universal reporting and computation framework I had proposed and designed. It
was still in common use years later.

As a reward for this slog, I was privileged to work on GWS, the front end that
generated all Google results pages, for i18n, l10n and translations, and the GWS
live experiment framework.

And I interviewed hundreds of engineers, traveling twice to Korea and once to
Hungary for this.

I used C++, Java and Python, and the usual string of Google technologies.

### <span> Senior software developer, Netomat </span> <span> (2001-2004) </span>

Netomat had an innovative rich media tool to let users and advertisers create
and send Netomat "experiences" â€“ little Java applet minisites with animation,
sound and internal navigation - to users who could edit them within the email
itself.  Yes, Java applets, but it seemed very plausible at the time.

I designed and wrote the animation engine and front-end, most of the animation
types and the manual.

Still one of my favorite "neat hacks" ever, I wrote a tool that converted
"experiences" (animations) right into Java bytecode, for a 40-80% savings in
download and memory size.
