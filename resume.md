I specialize in rapid development of highly reliable, performant, scalable, minimal,
clear and maintainable solutions to difficult problems.

Decades of experience! A plethora of projects taken from conception to completion, production, packaging and
distribution.

Expert in Python and C++, solid in Java, C and JS, conversant in many others.

## Employment Highlights

### <span>Lead Programmer, SuperDuperDB</span> <span>(May 2023 -- Sep 2023)</span>

https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb

SuperDuperDB is not a database, but a Python system integrating existing databases with
AI tools like vector search and LLMs.

I was tasked with making the working Python codebase "professional" so to be released to
the public as a library, and this I did, by writing many `pytest` tests, adding
practically complete typing enforced with `mypy`, refactoring and renaming and removing
cruft, and of course writing reams of readable class, method and function documentation.

I wrote design documents, really my favorite part: for _structured logging, monitoring,
and journaling_ (a small but very useful API which allowed repeatable computation with
fairly marginal extra effort); and for a _fully typed REST server_ (including a tiny
demo!) with an automatically generated OpenAPI specification.

### <span>CTO, Engora</span> <span>(April 2021 -- Feb 2023)</span>

[Engora](https://search.engora.tech/) was an innovative search engine for mechanical
engineering parts.

The founder created a good demo, and then raised money through crowdfunding. I came in
some months after as CTO: I had my hands in everything, but here are the bits I wrote
all of (Python, PostgreSQL, SqlAlchemy):

* A _parts crawler_ over two dozen disparate sites and a million parts, carefully
rate-limited, harvested directly, then proxied, finally using ScraperAPI's fancy new
asynchronous proxy.

* A PostgreSQL _parts database_ with key information from each parts page: I wrote a
small database quickly, then rewrote it entirely four months later.

* A _data store_ based on S3, using multiple providers, with an incremental offsite
"physical" backup stream; and on top of that, a _data resource management system_, for
convenient replication of projects containing multiple, reproducible resources,
including PostgreSLQ databases, directories and sharded files.

* A neat little proprietary _memory-mapped index_ for direct searching and
retrieval, and [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for text
searching.

* A Flask _web server_ (using nginx/gunicorn in production) and a couple of Dockers
  supporting all of these.

* Deployment, configuration files and variables, monitoring variables, logging, user
interaction journaling, and other unsexy but satisfying details.

* Practically complete test coverage of almost everything

* And to run all of those, a tidy [`typer`](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) CLI
named `engora`, with over two dozen commands and subcommands, hundreds of flags
and "practically complete" documentation,  used every day by almost everyone in the
company.

### <span>Lead developer on BiblioPixel, Maniacal Labs</span> <span> (2016-2019)

Maniacal Lab's BiblioPixel was a popular lighting control program written in Python that
controlled LEDs and smart bulbs in strips, matrices, cubes and other layouts.

I rewrote it from the ground up, adding a REST server for pixel and higher-level
control, code and data plug-ins, many animators including video feedback with an
IIR filter, and a new data model using `numpy` arrays, leading to very roughly a
30x speedup with perfect backwards compatibility.

Mostly Python, some Cython and C++. (I'd use
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instead of Cython if I
had to do it again.)

### <span> Senior software engineer at Ripple </span> <span>(2014-2016) </span>

Ripple is a financial technology firm with its own eponymous cryptocurrency. I
worked on their flagship application `rippled`, the complex and complicated
C++17 crypto-ledger that implements their XRP cryptocurrency, on the ledger
code, on deployment, debugging, devops, build and monitoring, mostly in C++ with
some Python.

### <span> CTO, World Wide Woodshed </span> <span>(2009-2014) </span>

I had always wanted to write a complete desktop audio application!

World Wide Woodshed's SlowGold was a leader in music practice software from the
1990s. I bought half the tiny company, and was the sole developer for a
brand-new product in C++, with high-quality audio, subtle and intuitive editing
tools, and little details like three second restart after shutdown.

We had many dedicated customers, but not enough to justify keeping in business,
so we shut down, and [open sourced the software](https://github.com/rec/slow_gold)
in 2016.

### <span> Software engineer, Google </span> <span> (2004-2009) </span>

I joined Google New York when it was a single floor overlooking Times Square, worked on
Google's first question-answering system, then their first Music Search, then its
short-lived Real Estate search, all in C++.

This led me to GoogleBase, a database of tens of billions of items planned for millions
of users. Leading a tiny and changing team, over two years we built a universal
reporting and computation framework in Python that I had proposed and designed: it was
still in common use years later.

As a reward for this slog, I was privileged to work on GWS, the front end program,
written in C++ that generated all Google results pages, for i18n, l10n and translations,
and the GWS live experiment framework.

And I interviewed hundreds of engineers, traveling twice to Korea and once to
Hungary for this.

I used C++, Java and Python, and the usual string of Google technologies.

### <span> Senior software developer, Netomat </span> <span> (2001-2004) </span>

Netomat had an innovative rich media tool to let users and advertisers create
and send Netomat "experiences" â€“ little Java applets (it seemed more reasonable
at the time) minisites with animation, sound and internal navigation - to users
who could edit them within the email itself.

I designed and wrote the animation engine and front-end, most of the animation
types and the manual.

Still one of my favorite "neat hacks" ever, I wrote a tool that converted "experiences"
right into Java bytecode, for a 40-80% savings in download and memory size.
