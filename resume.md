Decades of experience; a plethora of projects taken from conception to
completion and production, in areas including fintech, DSP, big data,
distributed systems and more; hundreds of thousands of lines of working,
production code in a dozen programming languages; expert in Python, and C++.

I specialize in rapid development of highly reliable, performant, scalable,
minimal, clear and maintainable solutions to difficult problems. "Everything
should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."

## Selected Experience

### <span>CTO, Engora</span> <span>Jan 2022 -- Jan 2023</span>

Engora is an innovative search engine


### <span>Contractor, A-Team</span> <span>January 2021 -- January 2022</span>

A-Team is a consultancy firm


### <span>Lead developer on BiblioPixel, Maniacal Labs</span> <span> (2016-2019)

Maniacal Lab's BiblioPixel is a popular lighting control program for LEDs in
strips, matrices, cubes and other layouts, as well as other lighting systems
such as the Philips Hue and DMX.

I rewrote it from the ground up, with a REST server for pixel and higher-level
control, both code and data plug-ins, animators including video feedback with an
IIR filter, and a new data model to numpy arrays, with order-of-magnitude
speedup and perfect backwards compatibility.

    Python, C++, Cython


### <span>Senior software engineer at Ripple </span> <span>(2014-2016) </span>

Ripple is a financial technology firm with its own eponymous cryptocurrency. I
worked for most of my time there on their flagship application rippled, a
complex and complicated C++17 cryptoledger named rippled on deployment,
debugging, devops, build and monitoring.

    C++, Python


### <span>Sole developer on SlowGold 8, World Wide Woodshed </span> <span>(2009-2014) </span>

I had always wanted to write a complete desktop audio application!

World Wide Woodshed's SlowGold was a leader in music practice software from the
1990s. I bought half the tiny company, and was the sole developer for a
brand-new product in C++, with high-quality audio, subtle and intuitive editing
tools, and little details like three second startup and shutdown.

    C++


### <span>Software engineer, Google </span> <span> (2004-2009) </span>

I joined Google New York as a single floor on Times Square, worked on their
first question-answering system, the first Music Search, then its short-lived
Real Estate search.

This led me to GoogleBase, a database of tens of billions of items planned for
millions of users. Leading a tiny and changing team, over two years we built a
universal reporting and computation framework I had proposed and designed. It
was still in common use years later.

As a reward for this slog, I was privileged to work on GWS, the front end that
generated all Google results pages, for i18n, l10n and translations, and the GWS
live experiment framework.

And I interviewed hundreds of engineers, traveling twice to Korea and once to
Hungary for this.

    C++, Java, Python


### <span> Senior software developer, Netomat </span> <span> (2001-2004) </span>

Netomat had an innovative rich media tool to send Netomat "experiences" â€“ little
minisites with animation, sound and internal navigation - to users who could
edit them within the email itself.

I designed and wrote the animation engine and front-end, most of the animation
types and the manual. Still one of my favorite "neat hacks" ever, I wrote a tool
that converted experiences right into Java bytecode, for a huge savings in
download and memory size.
