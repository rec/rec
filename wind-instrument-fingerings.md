# monoKey: A universal model for wind instrument and keyed brass fingerings

## Abstract

This paper introduces monoKey, a universal representation of fingerings for monophonic
keyed instruments like wind instruments and keyed brass.

## Definitions

**Monophonic** (mono) instruments only play a single note or tone at a time, like wind and
brass instruments.

A **key** is a button that can be pressed and held, or a hole that can be covered on an
instrument.

A **fingering** is a set of keys being pressed at the same time.

A **note-fingering** is a note and a fingering that can play it. ("Note" and "scale" are
used informally and generally here, see the `tuney` project for a full specification of
tunings and scales.)

A **fingering system** is a set of note-fingerings. In one sytem, one note can
correspond to many fingerings, and one fingering can correspond to multiple notes (a
**multi-note fingering** or **multi**), like in brass instruments or overblown winds.

(The final choice of note from a multi might depend on almost anything: breath,
embouchure, control information, randomness, or the state of the instrument
itself. Mostly this can't be formally represented, but there will be a special case for
the harmonic series, and a field for free-form text instructions to the performer, like
"overblow very hard, medium-tight embouchure".)

## Can we do better than just listing note fingerings?

Listing all the note-fingerings individually is the simplest way to go, and in many
cases will be the best way: looking at, say, the fingering charts of the varieties of
ocarina, there doesn't seem to be a clear organizing principle, and there are only a
small number of fingerings in brass.

But most wind instruments fingerings have a linearity to them, taking advantage of the
natural smoothness and speed of raising or lowering successive fingers in sequence.

Divide keys into **main** and **modifier** keys.

Each main key has its own unique human finger that presses it, so there are typically 6 to
9 main keys.







## Tricky edge cases

* Partly covered holes
* Brass instruments
